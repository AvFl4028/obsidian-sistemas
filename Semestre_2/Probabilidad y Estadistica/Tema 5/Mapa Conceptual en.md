# Types of Measurement Errors

## Random Error
- Unpredictable variation between successive measurements.
- Caused by uncontrollable external factors.
- Affects each measurement differently.
- Example:
  - A person's physical performance varies with mood.
  - _Another example: A student fills out an emotional self-evaluation form on different days with different results._

## Systematic Error
- Constant error associated with the measurement system or instrument.
- Affects all measurements consistently.
- Can be corrected if detected.
- Example:
  - Using a miscalibrated ruler will always give incorrect readings.
  - _Another example: A scale that consistently shows 100g more due to poor calibration._

## Negligible Error
- So small it doesn't affect the final results.
- Often ignored in practice.
- Example:
  - A 0.5 mm difference when measuring a 10-meter beam.
  - _Another example: A decimal reading outside visible scale that doesnâ€™t alter calculations._

## Significant Error
- Has a major impact on the result.
- Should not be ignored.
- Example:
  - An error when preparing a precise chemical solution.
  - _Another example: An incorrect dosage calculation in medicine._

## Instrument Defect Error
- Caused by damage, wear, or poor design of the measuring instrument.
- Requires maintenance or replacement.
- Example:
  - A thermometer that becomes uncalibrated over time.
  - _Another example: A multimeter with a broken display that shows wrong digits._

## Human Error
- Caused by the person taking the measurement: poor reading, misinterpretation, or carelessness.
- Includes parallax and transcription errors.
- Example:
  - Reading liquid level from the wrong angle.
  - _Another example: Writing down a 5 as an 8 on a form._

## Environmental Error
- Caused by external conditions: temperature, humidity, noise, dust, etc.
- Can affect sensitive instruments.
- Example:
  - Materials expand with heat.
  - _Another example: Weighing something while air currents affect the scale._
